       <h2>About Me</h2>

       <p>My name is Jordan Brndiar, I’m a 27-year-old artist from Connecticut. I’ve been making art from the time I could first pick up a pencil and I’ve been passionate about it ever since. I would describe my style as very “doodle-esque” but I enjoy exploring many different types of art. My favorite mediums to work with are marker and pencil but I like branching out to paint and digital artwork as well.</p>

       <p>I have a very free flowing design process where I take an initial concept and find the most appealing version of it through exploration within my sketchbook. After choosing my favorite version of a design, I then decide on the type of canvas, size, and medium I want to execute it with. Once the initial planning has been figured out, I put on my headphones and get to work.</p>

       <p>My work is completed only when I’m happy with the outcome, which in some cases can be in one sitting and in others may take me several days to complete. The end result however is always something I am proud of and I hope you can see that passion within my work as well!</p>
